A sentence explaining that these are independent teams within the board who work on super cool ideas/projects followed by links to all of our initiatives - Dev Team, JEDI, Impact, and Rustaceans! We should also have a collage of their logos next to links/descriptions! \r\n- [x] Add a quick explanation for `Leadership.`\r\n- [x] Add a line on our event calends and link to it for `How do I get involved? `\r\n- [ ] #551\r\n- [ ] Once the history page is ready, we should add a `How did ACM came to be?` or something along these lines and link to the history page with a sentence or two for context. \r\n- [ ] Once the officer's page is ready, we should add a` Who's who` section after the leadership and link it to the page!

open-source site was originally intended to be a stand-alone website. However, we would now like to keep it linked to ACM's main website. This naturally causes a weird navigation experience with no way to navigate back to the main ACM website from the open-source website. \r\n\r\nTo address think, I can think of two approaches: \r\n\r\n1. We add a back to the main site button on the home page (which is a little cringe) but acceptable for our purposes. \r\n2. We modify the navigation bar so that it includes links to our main website. \r\n\r\nIdeally, you'd experiment with both of these and see which feels more intuitive from a user's perspective.
